My personal portfolio homepage contains a navigation bar with links to About Me, Portfolio, Resume, and Contact farther down the page. The Contact contains links to my personal webpage and my LinkedIn and Github accounts. The Portfolio section contains some of my personal photography as placeholders, and I will be changing them out as the course progresses and I build a body of work.
